# intro-astro
Hands-on activities for intro (nonmajors) astronomy students
Activities are all printable and require minimal supplies (e.g., markers) making them suitable for low-technology classrooms

1. Asteroid Shapes: Measure roundness of a selection of massive asteroids and compare to their mass
2. Color Temperature: Compare the temperature of a range of objects with the wavelength of light they emit
3. Galaxy Sorting: Develop your own system for organizing galaxies based on their appearance
4. H-R Diagram: Make HR diagrams for the nearest and brightest stars, and identify the most common type of star
5. Rotation Curves: Compare expectations for rotation speed based on Kepler's laws and the solar system to the behavior of galaxies
6. Stellar Classification: Identify basic spectrum properties and classify a set of stellar spectra 
7. Stellar Distances: Measure periodic stellar variability and consider how standard candles are used to measure distance
8. Supernova Distances: Plot data on supernova distance and redshift and compare to expectations from Hubble's Law
